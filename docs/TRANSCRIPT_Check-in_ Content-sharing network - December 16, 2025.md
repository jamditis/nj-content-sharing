## **Meeting Purpose**

Check in on content network progress and plan next steps.

## **Key Takeaways**

* **Content Network Launch:** The NJ Content Sharing Network is launching with two tools: Distributed Media Lab (DML) for automated content widgets and PluckyWire for story-by-story sharing.  
* **Critical Blocker:** The network is stalled by a lack of full-text RSS feeds from key partners, especially NJ Spotlight, which prevents automated story ingestion.  
* **Pilot Editorial Meetings:** A pilot of monthly editorial meetings will launch in January with the initial 12 partners to build collaboration and gather feedback.  
* **IRE Panel:** Andy will moderate a panel on local news collaboration at the Jan 23 IRE mini-conference in NYC, inviting NJ partners to speak.

## **Topics**

### **Content Network Status & Blockers**

* **Objective:** Enable content sharing via two platforms:  
  * **Distributed Media Lab (DML):** For automated content widgets.  
  * **PluckyWire:** For story-by-story sharing.  
* **Blocker:** No partners have full-text RSS feeds.  
  * **Impact:** Prevents automated story ingestion, requiring manual uploads and risking missed content.  
  * **Priority:** Secure a full-text feed from NJ Spotlight.  
  * **Action:** Andrew will call John Mooney to clarify the technical need (CMS admin, not editorial).  
* **Attribution:** A default boilerplate will be set in PluckyWire for all republished stories, modeled on Granite State's language.

### **Partner Onboarding & Communication**

* **DML:** Dave is finalizing content agreements with NJ Spotlight, NJ Arts, NJ Statehouse, and South Jersey Climate News.  
* **PluckyWire:** A demo meeting for the 8 "content takers" will be held in early January.  
  * **Rationale:** To show a populated platform with real stories, making the value clear.  
* **Communication:** PluckyWire's automated weekly email will be enabled, but a custom, one-off email feature is also needed.

### **Open Editorial Meetings Pilot**

* **Goal:** Restart monthly meetings to foster collaboration and share story plans.  
* **Pilot Group:** The initial 12 partners will meet in late January to test the format.  
* **Proposed Structure:**  
  * **Roundtable:** Partners share upcoming story plans.  
  * **Regular Segment:** A data deep dive led by a guest speaker (e.g., Steve Sterling, NJ News Nerds).  
* **Contingency:** Partners can email updates if they cannot attend.

### **IRE Mini-Conference Panel**

* **Event:** IRE mini-conference (Jan 23, CUNY, NYC).  
* **Panel:** Joe will moderate a 50-min panel on local news collaboration.  
* **Speakers:** Joe will invite NJ partners (e.g., John Mooney) and consider other Northeast collaborators (e.g., Granite State News Collaborative).

## **Next Steps**

* **Andrew:**  
  * Call John Mooney to clarify the full-text RSS feed requirement.  
  * Confirm DML widget sharing process with Dave.  
  * Schedule the PluckyWire demo meeting for content takers (early Jan).  
  * Draft the default boilerplate language for PluckyWire.  
* **Joe:**  
  * Build the public-facing webpage for the NJ Content Sharing Network.  
  * Ask Johnny (Plucky) about a custom, one-off email feature.  
  * Invite speakers for the Jan 23 IRE panel.  
* **Joe & Andrew:**  
  * Schedule the pilot open editorial meeting for late January.
