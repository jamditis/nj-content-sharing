Hey, Joe, thank you so much.

[@6:35](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=395.3) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Sorry. Sorry.

[@6:36](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=396.3) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Thank you. Thanks so much for pinging me.

[@6:37](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=397.84) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
appreciate it. worries. Happens all the time. Happy Tuesday.

[@6:41](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=401.76) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Same to you.

[@6:44](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=404.08) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Stephanie's got to run to the bathroom quick, then she'll come back. We'll get started. How's everything going? Hey, good morning.  
I'm sorry. I just hung up. I'll be right back.

[@6:51](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=411.74) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
No worries. I get that.

[@6:55](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=415.8) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
So tell me about your trip. I don't think I got a chance to catch up with you. You're I to the other side of the world recently.

[@7:03](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=423.16) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
I had two back-to-back trips, and that, of course, got me really sick. I was going to say, holy jet lag and holy pneumonia or something.  
I do not recommend it.

[@7:13](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=433.54) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Around this time, too? That's got to be – that's a world record worst combination.

[@7:19](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=439.12) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Yeah. I mean, it was good work-wise, but everything else about it was totally debilitating. So the first one to Malaysia was the Global Investigative Journalism Network's annual conference.  
They have it every two years, a conference. And so about 1,800 or 2,000 journalists from around the world, but a lot in the global south.  
Yeah.

[@7:40](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=460.36) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
That's very cool. And how was the whole conference experience? Like, was it well-organized?

[@7:46](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=466.56) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
What was the – did they pay for the flight?

[@7:49](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=469.0) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Like, how did all the logistics work? That's what I'm most interested in for obvious reasons.

[@7:52](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=472.86) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
So the flight – I've been doing work with the Center for Collaborative Investigators.

[@8:00](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=480.001) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Journalism, which you guys have funded.

[@8:02](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=482.661) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, CCIJ, we like that. Yeah. So CCIJ covered almost all my expenses. I've been doing collaborations, you know, editing work for them for the past 18 months or so.  
So I got a super cheap flight. They were able to cover just about all my expenses.

[@8:21](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=501.841) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Wow.

[@8:22](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=502.881) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
That's so cool. And then I did two, I appeared on two panels and they both went really well. Like one was totally standing room only, like 250 people, like people getting turned away at the door.  
So it all, the presentations all went super well.

[@8:39](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=519.041) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Excellent.

[@8:40](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=520.021) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
And the conference was really good. You know, journals from around the world, especially those who've suffered from repression and other difficulties.  
And then, so then I came back for Thanksgiving and the next conference was with Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism.  
I that was in Jordan. And the Middle East, and that was like four days. And I was doing like GIS training over, you know, over two days with those reporters for environmental stories.  
So that was like hands-on data for, yeah, in another language. I don't recommend doing that. It's like with translators.

[@9:19](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=559.58) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
They're ripped, man.

[@9:20](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=560.86) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Holy smokes. But they're really good. They do amazing work. So the reporters did. Yeah. Hell yeah, that's really cool.  
So I came back and I was utterly trashed.

[@9:31](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=571.9) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
was trashed. How long were you down for?

[@9:34](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=574.66) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Jeez. Oh, in Jordan, I literally would do the training and then go up to the hotel room and just fall asleep.

[@9:40](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=580.3) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I was just – I've never been to Jordan, but my friend Simon and I – well, first of Simon's been to Jordan.  
And he went there for a couple of months, I think, back in the day. But we went to Tunisia together.

[@9:52](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=592.6) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Oh, my God. That must be amazing.

[@9:55](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=595.04) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
It was amazing. It would have been amazing. I was. But we went to Perugia for, you know, IJF. I want to say 2018, but we decided, hey, let's do a little skip across the Mediterranean down from Italy and go see Tunisia and leave the conference two days earlier or whatever.  
And we had about a day, maybe 48 hours total in Tunisia. And I don't know if it was a combination of bad luck or the fact that we had been drinking every night in Peruvia until like three in the morning.

[@10:23](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=623.521) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
I'm sure it wasn't bad.

[@10:25](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=625.181) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I'm sure it was just the universe conspiring. But by the time we touched down in Tunisia, I was already starting to feel it a little bit.  
was like, man, I'm feeling a little woozy, a little hot, a little sweaty. And by the time we had our 13 and a half hour flight back to Fimochino and then to Newark, I was full on in the throes of the flu, which I didn't realize at the time, in the very last row of an Airbus or whatever it was.  
Oh, God. no recline, middle seat, very last row up against the bulkhead or whatever it's called.

[@10:56](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=656.221) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Yeah. Bathroom.

[@10:57](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=657.681) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Gorgeous. I I did manage to make it out there. Walk around, saw the Mediterranean Sea, had a falcon on my shoulder that caused me – Oh my god.  
That sounds epic. You know, it was great. We saw the ruins of Carthage and everything, all while it's like a light drizzle, which only made things even worse.

[@11:16](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=676.321) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Wow.

[@11:17](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=677.081) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
It was – I'd say it was worth it, but at the time I wanted to die, and I thought I might actually do that.  
So that was my only experience there. That was like the most international world hopping that I've done.

[@11:29](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=689.081) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Well, that's amazing. I've never been to Perugia. I've never been to Perugia. I've heard a lot of international journalists talk about it.

[@11:36](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=696.061) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, it's great. Before the pandemic, it was the place to go, and it was also the first international journalism conference to officially shut down and cancel in 2020\.

[@11:47](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=707.761) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Is that right? The first?

[@11:49](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=709.581) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, was like – well, it was the bellwether. That was like the – okay, they canceled the IJF.

[@11:55](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=715.481) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
This is really serious.

[@11:56](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=716.481) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
It's like, you know, we're going to have to completely rethink our event strategy. All That's what, you know, basically tipped us that, okay, we can't go to Charlotte.  
got to go virtual. Ended up working out for us, but, you know, obviously not for all the people who died, but, you know.

[@12:09](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=729.861) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Yeah. Well, that's really awesome. Yeah.

[@12:12](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=732.581) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Wow.

[@12:13](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=733.101) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
I've never been to Malaysia.

[@12:14](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=734.081) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
got invited to, I think I got invited to Malaysia to speak at a conference maybe a year ago, but they ended up not, they ended up having to remove me from the list of speakers because they overbooked something or whatever, and I ended up being like, oh, thanks anyway.  
I was really excited. I thought it would have been really cool. I've never been to Asia.

[@12:31](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=751.721) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
I mean, other than technically Asia in Iraq, but I've never been to Eastern I've never been that far. I've never been to Malaysia either.  
That was my first time. So I think I'd like a day to walk around and then the rest of it.

[@12:46](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=766.461) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah. I was say, what's the infrastructure like? Because I've heard really good things.

[@12:49](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=769.661) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Oh, it's totally like first world. Like you walk around Kuala Lumpur and you feel like, you know, there's no, there's nothing.  
Yeah. That's stressful about it as a city. It's even, it feels less congested than New York. Yeah, I thought it was going to be more hustle and bustle than New York, and instead it was the opposite.  
It was, it felt dialed back. People were super friendly.

[@13:17](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=797.621) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
That is really cool. That's really cool.

[@13:20](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=800.881) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
The food is amazing.

[@13:22](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=802.901) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Oh, nice.

[@13:24](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=804.501) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
But, but, you know, it's, it's conference land. So that's always, I always feel like it's really hard to judge a city when you're largely like in a big conference hotel kind of thing.

[@13:34](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=814.581) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, I mean, that's how I feel as well, where I end up, you know, it's, you know, conference is so overwhelming sometimes, especially if you had to fly and go crazy for it.  
And that I ended up just being like, I'd rather, I love the city. I'm glad I would love to explore it, but I need to just recharge in my hotel room.  
And next thing you know, I have Pizza Hut all over on the second queen size bed, the eating bed, and then I keep the sleeping bed clean.

[@13:58](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=838.501) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
I was, I, I. I'd to confess, I was far more that. Yeah.

[@14:03](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=843.242) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
No, there's nothing to be ashamed of.

[@14:05](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=845.542) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
That's a natural.

[@14:07](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=847.222) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Conferences take a lot more out of you than people think.

[@14:09](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=849.562) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Well, also like the flight of like 24 hours. Definitely don't recommend it. Exactly. Yeah.

[@14:13](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=853.842) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Highly doubt that that was enjoyable.

[@14:16](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=856.762) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
So I'm done. I am like so done with travel.

[@14:19](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=859.882) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I am like done, like staying. Glad to have you back. Yep. Glad to you back.

[@14:24](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=864.762) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
And it's great catching up with everybody. I've been touching base with Johnny and touching base with Dave.

[@14:32](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=872.262) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah. So let's, let's jump into that.

[@14:34](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=874.502) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Where do you want to start? I could start randomly. And then if you want to rejigger how I start.

[@14:40](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=880.562) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah.  
ACTION ITEM: Email Joe the Dave–Mark (South Jersey Climate) intro thread \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=885.9999)

[@14:41](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=881.002) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
So, yeah, go ahead. So Dave reached out and asked me to. Okay, great. So Dave asked me to reach out and connect him with everybody.  
Obviously, Diane Michele is, is doing what she's doing. Yeah. But I did connect Dave with Mark over at South Jersey.  
I connected, I can forge you the email.

[@15:03](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=903.722) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Okay, you connected with those people, okay.

[@15:05](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=905.182) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
They're just totally like low-key informal emails to try to get those, whatever small, you know, I figure with NJ Arts and J.  
Lustig, with everybody, it's just like a low, they don't need to go through a bureaucracy to sign this stuff.  
It's just a matter of Deb and Mark, Deb at NJ Statehouse, Mark, you know, at South Jersey Climate, and then Jay at NJ Arts.  
They just need to sign it, and I assume it's just going to be them figuring it out. So, and then I had a long conversation with Dave about a bunch of things.

[@15:40](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=940.722) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
My God, I've had so many long conversations with Dave. Oh, my God, I'm glad that, I'm glad that you have that mantle now, sir.

[@15:46](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=946.122) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Well, well, I actually, it was good, it was good to hear, like, how he has seen things flow, and Johnny's given me a little bit of that, too.  
So, um, uh, um, obviously. We're going to try to ask the providers of content, NJSpotlight and on down, to do a lot of the posting of stories.  
I'm going to be really curious to see what they have the bandwidth for and don't have the bandwidth for, and then how much I'll have to shoulder.  
The one thing I worry about is if I'm posting all of their stories or part of their stories, I worry about missing something that's like really awesome, you know.  
Yeah, yeah, yep. Because I'm not in their newsroom, so I can read their site, but if, God forbid, like a really good story is like, is buried somewhere on their site but was posted, you know.

[@16:38](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=998.442) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
So Dave is talking to all of them about the content agreement.

[@16:43](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1003.66) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Content agreement, that's correct. Okay, great, okay. So that he can create widgets and flow their stuff in, okay. Correct.  
And then Dave showed me some of the widgets, particularly ones that, like, they could just have, like, a steady stream.  
Yes. Which would definitely work for We're like the Hudson Post kind of sites. That's right.

[@17:04](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1024.28) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
could just have like a steady stream of like around the state or whatever. That's exactly what I think most people will understand best.

[@17:12](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1032.78) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
I totally agree. But so anyway.

[@17:18](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1038.82) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Okay. So he's doing that with those four.

[@17:21](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1041.3) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Okay. Right. And then we'll, and then the idea is then that we would have a gathering of our takers, content takers, like, it sounds like it'll be like the first week of January or something like, I mean, I could try this.

[@17:37](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1057.56) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
So, so, so the, so, so the point is then with him is you're looking at these four orgs that are willing to share their content so we can create little widgets and we can say, hey, anyone who wants to use this little widget.  
It's there. To have a flow of constant content and whatever product you may be trying to fill, you can use that.  
Okay.

[@18:00](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1080.0) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Right. And then Dave said his experience is two things from California. One is that most local, hyperlocal news sites who are taking content, they tend to do it on the weekends because their workload is less.  
And he just says that's his experience. The other thing is he said that is sites who say they're going to be picky actually turn out not to be picky because it's easier to just take the fire hose.

[@18:24](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1104.04) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[@18:25](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1105.68) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Yeah. Which I get. I get.

[@18:27](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1107.68) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah.

[@18:28](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1108.32) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Okay.

[@18:28](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1108.68) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
So because I want to try to like also start to put a framework behind the overall content sharing network that we're creating, you know, so because I want to be able to put this publicly.  
ACTION ITEM: Build internal content-sharing portal/dashboard; include DML widgets, PluckyWire, Daily News Roundup, editorial-meeting poll \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1119.9999)  
This is for you, Joe. So open your ears here. Joe's bot. Joe's bot. want to create a page on our website that has these items pretty soon so that Andy has a.  
It's place to start directing people so that we can say the New Jersey Content Sharing Network, you know, if you want a, you know, if you want to get content that is Washington, D.C.  
news, you know, here's a widget. Would you describe this as a showcase, a dashboard, or a portal, or something else?  
Showcase is more like, showcase is more along the lines of here's what we've done and presenting to the public.  
No, no. Dashboard is more like user, you know, partners and members can go there to find resources or current information.  
Portal is a more deep version of the dashboard where they can have individual resources and stuff like that. So let me keep going.  
something else. yeah. And tell me, because I think it's a cross between a portal and a dashboard. So, and the reason why I'm bringing this up is just so that, as we talk about the other things, Andy's going to talk about Plucky and what else.  
Okay. So, Andy's. Because you're going to be sending this out via email, but I also want to put it on our website publicly so that we can say, so other people, can start directing them and saying, if you're interested in this, this is what you do.  
So we're going to have a section for, you know, if you want a widget for your news product, we have that available through Distributed Media Lab.  
You can choose these different kinds of widgets, or if you want, you know, something customized, let us know. So then join PluckyWire.  
These news organizations are making their content available in PluckyWire. If you want to join PluckyWire and, you know, get individual stories from fellow New Jersey news organizations, click here.  
Then I also, like, next year, hopefully by February, I'd like us to start with, you know, you working with John more to share, like, story recipes, data, and then working with him to host open editorial meetings, too.  
So I also. Also want to like talk about how we start to move toward that as well. So that's all for Joe's bot because Joe will come back in a minute.

[@21:10](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1270.92) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
And then my only question for you, Stephanie, is with, I thought one of the things we were going to do next is take the eight takers in our group, the data takers, and then story takers, and then see, excuse me, how PluckyWire and DML actually play in real life.

[@21:28](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1288.18) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Because within the next few days, both PluckyWire and DML should be totally populated with real content.

[@21:36](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1296.98) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
So they can actually. And this, yes, totally.

[@21:40](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1300.4) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
We're not going to share this publicly yet, Andy, but we're going to build it now. Yep. Yeah. So they'll be populated.

[@21:46](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1306.24) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Great. So they'll be populated. They're being populated right now. Both Dave is populating DML with stories as if everyone is going to sign the agreement.  
And then Johnny has been populating it. And so have I. I've gone.

[@22:00](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1320.0) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
into PluckyWire to populate some stories just to see how it flows, which begged that question about boilerplate.

[@22:06](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1326.5) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
And I think we can deal with that in a moment. So I think our demos are actually pretty well set.  
Once we have the agreement signed, we can bring in then the Mercer Mee's and Woodbury Warblers and Hudson Posts of the world.  
They can look at it and they can look at it and say, well, this works and this sucks. You know, and then we can, and then we can figure out how to deal with their needs then.  
And then I totally agree with you. Then we'd be totally, if we do that the first week of January, then we're kind of all set to be on track to do, you know, to then do the more, and then iron out the kinks, whatever those kinks may be, and hope that they're minimal.  
ACTION ITEM: Draft boilerplate attribution text; send to Stephanie for review \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1375.9999)  
Yep. And then roll it forward. And then obviously tomorrow's meeting on photos will be great. I look forward to that.

[@22:57](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1377.98) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yep. Okay. Great. you. Thank you. Thank Thank you. And yeah, then that's the next thing too, is images and photos.  
Okay. So.

[@23:06](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1386.5) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
And then Stephanie, my question for you on the boilerplate is, I really liked the language that Johnny suggested from Granite State.  
So I was just going to try to adopt something and send it to you. And then you could say, and then there's just the generic one.  
And then I hadn't quite realized, because when I look at it in the system, you don't quite see it.  
But he says that when a story is repurposed, it would actually have the, it wouldn't just have the byline of the journalist.  
would also say, you know, JLustig of NJArts.net or something like that. So that the attribution of the news site would be embedded with the article.  
So that way we don't, and then we could see how that works.

[@23:49](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1429.94) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
And if we need to have customizable boilerplates for every fricking newsroom in the state. I don't think we will.  
Yeah. So the boilerplate, then would that come, does that, because I forget, does that come through? Through, when you hit copy, is it automatically appended to the bottom?

[@24:04](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1444.44) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
You have to, you can make it a default setting. Okay. And then if someone wants to have it read something else, you can, but we could make it a default setting where it would just say, this story is provided through the New Jersey News Commons, you know, get more, you know, share more hyperlocal, whatever that language was that Granite State had, you know.  
Please keep sharing local content because it matters that you get local news or whatever. So you're going to write that and send it to me and I'll take it.  
And then you'll, and then you'll edit it and make it, you know, more legible.

[@24:38](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1478.16) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yep. Or not more legible. Okay, cool. Good. That sounds good. Okay. Yeah. I think once we're able to see some of these widgets and see Plucky in action, like populated, it'll start to come together.  
But I just want to be super clear with people. That that's part of also why I want us to build a page now, even though we're not going to share it publicly.  
Yeah. So that we can share it with these people is kind of a challenge too.

[@25:04](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1504.8) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Totally. That makes total sense.

[@25:06](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1506.62) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
you like, I just want, I keep repeating this just because I keep it clear in my head. Like if you want a widget of other people's news content to fill out your news products, here's a widget.  
You can choose from these varieties. You can have this news, this news, this news. If you want to, you know, share or take individual stories from fellow news or organizations, you can look at PluckyWire anytime.  
Here's where you can see PluckyWire and see what's available. Set up your account here. So my other question then is, as we are able to start sharing statewide content that can be customized, that can be localized.  
You know, we have this coming up, this coming up, this coming up, this data coming up. How do we best share that with people?  
We've been doing that primarily through the Listserv now. Are we going to continue to let people know that it's available via the Listserv?  
But then they have to. Go to Plucky to get it. Like how, what is, what do you think is going to be the workflow for that?  
I don't, I'm not sure I have the perfect answer for it. I do.

[@26:11](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1571.56) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
I think talking with Dave, it sounds like, and I should run this by Johnny too, to see what his experiences are in Washington State and Granite State.  
But it sounds like it's, it should be like a, maybe cross posting the same post. So like we send a newsletter or some email newslettery thing.  
We put something on the listserv and just try to figure out where people are responding to whatever it is we send.  
I don't know.

[@26:39](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1599.58) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Does Plucky let you email everyone who has an account?

[@26:43](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1603.74) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
I don't know the answer. I don't know the answer.

[@26:46](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1606.26) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Let me, let me ask him that right now. Um, because, cause then we could tell people, um, you know, if, if, if you have an account with Plucky, you'll get off.  
All of our news content, communicating with the collaborator. Is there a new plugin for us to email everyone who is part of our group tool?  
So basically, we want to alert them to new content.

[@27:33](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1653.18) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
It looks like, yeah, I'll share my screen with you guys. Yeah, go ahead. a second.  
SCREEN SHARING: Andrew started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1662.891164)

I haven't signed into Plucky. I need to accept my Plucky Wire. I was meaning to do that.

[@27:46](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1666.58) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
So this is what Plucky Wire looks internally? Yep. So, uh, you could, there's that.

[@27:58](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1678.96) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I started, I started. started to mess around to redesign the front end of it, and then I realized that was a waste of my time.

[@28:04](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1684.2) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Yeah.

[@28:05](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1685.1) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Oh, invite has expired.

Oh, let me – I think I can send you another invite, and Joe should also have me.

I'm in. Yeah, I already messed up his system by creating an outlet for the center and then realizing that that would cost him more money, so we deleted it.  
But then he emailed me after I already deleted it and said, I saw you're creating an outlet. You can do that, but just want to make sure.  
Okay, so if you go explore content sharing groups.

[@28:34](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1714.44) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)

So we already have a group. We have an NJ News Commons group. Oh, okay. If go back and then you click on NJ News Commons.

Yeah. So here's our users. We have tags, boilerplates. We can change roles. Hold on, Stephanie, I'm going to mute you.  
can hear myself. That's okay. We have our dashboard here where we can do all this, and we can't message people directly, I don't think.  
But if you go to your groups, if you go to our open groups or create your own group, and you scroll down, you can find, and all this is going to do.  
Okay.

I don't think it allows you to message, though.

[@29:53](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1793.78) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
No, it doesn't allow you to message. so. Amen. Settings. Okay. RSS Upload Routes. What's it here? This is Open Library.  
Yep. And then you said members. So is a weekly automated update with the recent stories, stats, and custom announcements.  
ACTION ITEM: Update PluckyWire logo; test weekly digest \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1844.9999)  
So yes. So we could turn that on. We could preview our email. This is what it'll look like. I got to change that logo to a better one.  
Send me a test email. Let's see. Let's see. PluckyWire test. Story share. Total one. How is there only? Oh, these are the 10 most recent stories.  
God, this is so ugly. Wish I could help him fix this. I feel like that's rude. Cool. All right, good.  
So, yeah, basically, we can add additional recipients. Yes, ma'am. Yep, I'm going to give you control of my screen real quick.  
Hang on. Specific days of the week? Twice daily. Ah. I don't think you can do that. Okay, let's see what he says.  
Hey, look at all the outlets that have joined.

[@32:10](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=1930.96) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Look at this. Isn't that great? Yeah, those are all – Johnny put those in. I gave him the list of all the outlets, and Johnny put those in.

It just keeps sharing the Zoom window, so I've to fix that by settings. All right, you're in. Let's see.  
Members, users, Murray, owner. You are now – you're now an owner. Wait, why did – oh, whoops. Look, Mark Berkey-Gerrard signed in with my email address.  
I'm to remove him and add a new user. There we go.

He be an owner. should be a – No, because he used – I did that. I wanted to see if it would break, and I forgot I did that.  
He was like, I didn't get my invite, and I was like, here, use this link. And I had a suspicion that it was going to be tied to my email.  
And so, yeah. You're in? Yeah. So, yeah, at the top, you you have the RSS feed. You can set up your RSS feed.  
I tried to do this, and this is – and it kind of, like, broke it a little bit. tried to do one for the center, but it didn't want to do that because we have a no robot.  
We have robots.txt issues. So, upload a story.

[@33:47](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2027.66) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
We don't have an RSS feed configured, so – Nobody does.

Nobody – Yeah. Spotlight does have one, but it doesn't pull the whole story.

[@33:57](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2037.9) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
It just pulls – It pulls like a couple cents. Yeah, and so we're trying to schedule a meeting right now with – So we need them to make – we need a full text RSS feed.  
So Johnny wants to meet with the folks at NJ Spotlight. So those are the emails you might see going around with John Mooney.  
So John Mooney is trying to get the website people on his site to try to create – know, with the hope – what we're hoping is that they should be able to create a more robust RSS feed.  
And that would slay a lot of dragons. And if they don't do it, then it's just more work for everybody.

[@34:43](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2083.54) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
And we also – not only is it more work, but we run the risk of missing something. Set a profile picture.  
Sucks. Okay. I see analytics dash. So that's already happening. Do we have full-text RSS feeds for anyone else?

Nobody has a full-text RSS feed. Jay Lustig does not have one. Neither does South Jersey Climate News. Neither does New Jersey Statehouse News.

[@35:19](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2119.36) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Nobody. What? How difficult is it to set up a full-text RSS feed? It's not.

[@35:29](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2129.39) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
It's not. But if there's only one person, we get to have a full-text RSS feed. If we could just get New Jersey Spotlight to do it.  
That's we need, yeah. That's all we need. And then if we were to get Jay Lustig to do it as well, that's great too.  
But the other ones are so infrequent posters, I'm not sure.

[@35:47](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2147.81) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I don't know.

[@35:49](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2149.69) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
To prioritize it, let's just get NJ Spotlight first.

[@35:52](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2152.81) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Then if it turns out to be super easy, we could talk with the others. It looks like NJ.com does, but obviously they're not part of this.  
Let's see. We'll happens if we do. So then there's this, like, which outlet will manage this? And this is where I ran into an issue because I went to go create.  
I don't want any of these guys to manage our stuff. So I wanted to create the center as an outlet, and I hit a wall.  
It wouldn't let me do that. And I have to assign, so I don't know. I'm going to choose NJSpotlight for now.  
And I'm going to enable automatic story import, default series, default embargo.

[@36:46](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2206.89) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
And by the way, Stephanie, that's where the boilerplate is, the default boilerplate. So we would want to set it so that it's always.  
ACTION ITEM: Remove NJ.com RSS from PluckyWire; set NJ Spotlight as import outlet \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2212.9999)

[@36:57](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2217.39) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Fetch now. Fetch Fetch now. Fetch Zero, 50 new items. Okay, so let's view that. Who did you just add there?  
NG.com. Okay, so you got to take that out, you know. I am, know, I know. Yeah, that's, I mean, it's a public artist.  
Okay, so there we go. So now I can preview. This is what we get, just the picture for this one.  
First carjacked. we get any full text? We get article body, but we can't click out. Does this work? Yes.  
Okay, so then I got to, I got to do this. All right, so those are good notes for Johnny, Johnny B.  
Okay. Okay, so these things are in motion. Okay. So Joe, can you, I told you about everything that we needed.  
I had to jump off and I need something from you as a result of my conversation as well. So then you need me to sign something.  
All Thank So the other thing, Andy, just thinking ahead for early next year after we get this set up, I also do want to then think about, let's see how we can email people because I do want to also start being able to send customizable stories to people and share data easily.  
And then we want to restart open editorial meetings, which we tried to do with Ben Hulak and John Mooney, but we didn't really structure them very well.  
But if we can just start those again, like the end of January and get a date on the calendar so that it's you, Mooney, us, and then we at least have Ben there and maybe someone else from Spotlight.  
We have to figure out a way to structure them so that they're useful. Yeah, was going to say that one of the meetings is to what, to have them check in and ask questions and stuff, like open office hours?  
Yeah, it's kind of open office hours. But what I was hoping that Spotlight would do would say, here's what we're working on for the next month.  
Here are some of the bigger things coming up for the next month or two months and talk about some of their story planning so that other organizations would, you know, and then other organizations could also share.  
We're working on if something's not competitive, like if something's super competitive, they don't want to share it clearly. But, like, you know, we're also working on this long-term, you know, housing affordability, and we could, you know, we want other people to know because we're either looking for help, looking for sources, or we want, you know, we're going to make it available or, you know, something like that.  
So it's kind of a looking ahead planning meeting, but also a give and take. Like, but we ended up, we tested it before, just with Ben, it was a focus on Washington, D.C.  
coverage, and that was fine, but it attracted a pretty small group of News Commons members.

[@39:59](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2399.19) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Yeah. So you think like having a very New Jersey focused one, which makes sense to me, would be, would have a better, would have a better opportunity.

[@40:07](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2407.79) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, also having Ben there to just share, here's what's coming up out of DC too. Yeah, and like just have, we needed to have it a little bit more, right?  
What we did originally, it was basically Ben would get on there and tell us what stories he was working on.  
Yes. And then it would spend 20 minutes just sort of talking, him and John Moni and whatever would talk about the details of that story.  
And then anybody else on the call, eventually they would be like, so does anybody want to run this? Or does anybody have any help with sourcing?

[@40:32](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2432.05) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
I've been on calls like that, they're deaf.

[@40:33](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2433.93) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
and they were like, not really, I think that would be cool, let us know when the story's out. That's, yeah.  
So also it's like, do we, yeah, do we plan like a speaker then? So the beginning of the meeting is, here's a look ahead, anyone wants to, you know, do a look ahead planning, but then we have like a speaker to talk about like a specific story?  
Like, do we, like, do we leverage Steve Sterling and the news nerds thing that he's building? I think, I think that's a good idea.  
idea. think also we could have, you know, preset segments where we do, you know, updates on the analytics and the traffic, like how, what story is performing well, a very brief overview at the top five, 10 minutes.  
And then we have a range of different topic segments. And we either have a, you know, a speaker, like you said, or a specific issue or feature updates, like, you know, talk to the developer to see what, you know, was working, what's not working, what features need to be added.  
We can do, like, a menu of different things that we rotate as needed, including, yeah, like, including specific story topics and stuff like that and collaborations.  
But I think being able to have one-on-one time with Johnny, with the developer, would be really cool. Maybe not every single time, but to be able to hear feedback from the users.  
Well, this is an open editorial meeting, though. Oh, I see. Okay, never mind then.

[@41:50](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2510.09) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
I mean, if I were, if I were sitting in that meeting and listening to it, I think what I would want at the top is a very quick recitation of, like, oh, here's what we have coming out.  
You know, the... New Jersey Legislature is getting, you know, is back in session. We're expecting three stories, one on affordability, one on environment, one on this.  
Expect fights between the Democrats and Republicans on this one thing.

[@42:13](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2533.59) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Next, we have a- is exactly what Ben was doing. Yes, that's exactly what Ben was doing.

[@42:19](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2539.01) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
But then also quickly say like, you know, from South Jersey climate, we're expecting stories about, you know, Superfund site, this thing.

[@42:28](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2548.09) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
That's right. If we, if Andy, if you prep people a little bit more in advance, because I wasn't prepping anyone at all.  
If you prep some people to speak, and then we also invite like- Yeah, I think, I think also we got to make sure that we're not doing meetings that could be an email as well.  
We got to balance that. So we can have people who can't attend. They, you know, an email goes out two days before, say, hey, we're having a monthly editorial meeting.  
You know, you can, here's the link to join, but if you can't make it, you know, reply to this email with, you know,  
Your latest stories are forthcoming or your updates and everything. And then if you really want, Andy, what we can do is Slack channels allow you to create an email address for the channel.  
So you can have people send a reply to the email and it'll go directly to you on Slack in our content sharing channel.  
So you don't have to worry about digging through your inbox when they want to send their updates on anything.  
That's for later down the road.

[@43:21](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2601.11) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Okay.

[@43:23](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2603.39) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
But yeah, I think that's a good idea. I think as long as it's useful and it allows for people who can't make it to still contribute without ending up where nobody participates and they just send an email.  
And if that's the case, if that's how it works, that's fine. But we just want to balance the usefulness of the meeting with the recurring, like the ritual of checking in and being part of a collaboration type of thing.  
ACTION ITEM: Schedule pilot open editorial meeting (late Jan) w/ Mooney, Ben; prep agenda/speakers \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2621.9999)

[@43:52](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2632.91) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
So do you want to try that maybe like the third or fourth week in January with just the 12 who are participating?  
So So far and see how that goes. And then we could use that as our beta group. And if they all say afterwards, the meeting sucks and here's why, or the meeting is great and I like this bit of it, then that could be part of our feedback too for a wider meeting to figure out what works for them.

[@44:16](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2656.59) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, I think that's a good, we'll do a pilot, we'll do a test. Stephanie's in the News Nerds channel, which I think you're in.  
I was just going say, is Andy in that? He is in that, but I don't know how active he's checking Slack, but I would check what Steve Sterling's posting.  
He's like sharing data sets and other things like that, that I think would be really good content for like, we're featuring and we're talking about it, you know, as topic selections in the bag.  
Yeah, like I'm wondering how we don't leverage some of this.

[@44:53](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2693.75) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Which is this, I'm sorry, in the News Nerds things?

[@44:56](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2696.71) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, like NJ News Nerds, I think you're in.

[@44:59](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2699.65) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
They should be. I just see an invite now from Thursday.

[@45:03](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2703.61) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Sorry. Got it.

[@45:04](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2704.45) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Okay. Now I'm in.

[@45:05](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2705.75) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, we got to get you checking on Slack more often. That way you'll be up to date. Yeah, and I'm just, you know, like, do, what if, I mean, like, what if the monthly open editorial meeting started with a roundtable of planning, but then every month we dug into a data set?  
What if it was just as simple as that? Data deep dive, data dig? I think so, too. think we do.  
Or something that's regular. blocks that we can, you know, swap in and out. I mean. Yeah, I think that's great.  
I can put together a menu like that if you want. When I'm doing the stuff that you noted for the bot later for the dashboard portal thing, we can also, you know, we can make it everything from we have a set of types of content or agenda items that we can do, or we can even have that portal include, like, what should we talk about at our next meeting?  
A little poll in the sidebar or something so that we have more guidance. Thank Because I do think if we gave people something useful at every meeting, and here is like every open monthly editorial meeting, we're going to talk about, you know, big upcoming stories, potential collaborations, asks and offers, and then we will talk about an upcoming or useful data set for local reporting.  
That, like, you know, Steve Sterling is like chomping at the bit for that, like he could help with that, and take something off Andy's plate, you know.

[@46:32](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2792.29) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Could Steve talk about like the limitations, you know, like how to use the data, like every data set has its, you know, what it's really good for, and then what it's like, know.

[@46:40](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2800.69) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Have you worked with him before?

[@46:41](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2801.67) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Do you know him? I don't know him.

[@46:43](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2803.67) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Okay. Yeah, he's a data reporter at the Philly Enquirer. He used to work for the Star Ledger at Esbury Park Press.  
He's pretty good. And yeah, I think that he could. He's a good guy, yeah. I think that you might be able to guide him a little  
If you, you know, but I'm just thinking about other ways we can involve more people. He brings in another kind of network into this and it would take advantage of his interest.  
He is feeling very disconnected from New Jersey in some ways because that's part of the reason why he's interested in restarting the Slack channel.  
He works for the Philly Inquirer, but he's remote and he lives up in Morristown. And he, he had worked for the Asbury Park Press.  
He's been at the Inquirer, what, two years now?

[@47:32](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2852.73) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
A year and a half? Something like that? Does the Inquirer still do a lot of South Jersey coverage or are they like begging off it?

[@47:39](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2859.07) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, they do. They do.

[@47:41](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2861.01) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
They do.

[@47:41](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2861.79) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I frequently go there for stories for the news roundup. Yeah. Yeah. So I think this could also be a way to grab Steve back, you know?  
Speaking of which, I do think that there is a way to bring the Daily News roundup into this as a vehicle for  
That should also be on the landing page, but keep going. Yeah, so I don't want to assign anything necessarily, but Andy and I should work together to figure out, and with the group, figure out what would be a good way to integrate the stuff from the news network, the content sharing network, and make sure that it has a prominent feature in the daily news roundup.  
Yeah, yes, yes. Updates to that as we speak, but yeah.

[@48:27](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2907.03) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
So if I was like a local news, you know, Woodbury Warbler or whatever, if I saw the daily roundup, some of those stories I would not be able to repurpose for my site.

[@48:42](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2922.07) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Right, Most of them you probably wouldn't, but what we would end up doing – Stephanie, I'm going to – oh, I can't mute you.  
Oh, I'm sorry. What I would end up doing is having a featured section for – or either featured section, which I think is probably the way to go, or a little icon next to stories that can be republished with a link to the PluckyWorks dashboard.  
Thank you. Thank Thank you. you. So right now, are you familiar with what it looks like, you know, generally speaking?

[@49:05](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2945.23) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
I've seen it, yeah.

[@49:06](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2946.91) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, it's super basic. It's just, you know, six sections. It's top stories, politics, housing, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[@49:11](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2951.95) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Yeah.

[@49:12](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=2952.51) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
So we can, and we can do a little feature callout box, and or we can, you know, put a little recycle or whatever repost emoji or icon next to the stories, and then hyperlink that.  
So all they have to do is click on it, and it'll take them to that story ID in PluckyWire.  
The thing with that, though, I think, is that it would probably have to just take you to log in or become a member because the news roundup, the newsletter is for public, you know, average news consumers.  
It's really the only people who give a about it are publishers mostly, but it is not a publisher-only, you know, private newsletter.  
So we would want to make sure that we bake in something that doesn't just, that pushes people towards a pipeline for joining the network as opposed to just...  
... ... ... ... ... You know, having something on there that the average news consumer doesn't know what to do with.  
So I'm thinking probably a section, we can just do it from our, from the New Jersey Content Exchange or whatever we're calling it.  
And we'll do as a featured section and then we'll talk to Plucky about, we'll talk to Johnny about what kind of integration we can have with direct links to, you know, the republication, the story ID or something.

[@50:23](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=3023.83) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Now, now, forgive me if I'm confused, but don't we want, like, if I was receiving the email of a New Jersey news site, wouldn't I want to give them both the options of whether they want to pull a story from DML or Plucky Wire?

[@50:37](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=3037.05) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Like, we don't really care.

[@50:38](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=3038.21) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
We don't care, yeah. We don't care where they get the story as long as they get the story.

[@50:42](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=3042.19) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yes, yeah. From our perspective, yes, it's more, it's, yes, you're absolutely right. I'm just saying, like, we would have some way for them to do that from the newsletter or a way to highlight the republishable stories or whatever.  
Whatever that looks like, it would depend on what we talked to Dave and Johnny about and how that, how that works for both platforms.

[@51:01](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=3061.49) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
And they're good with each other, right?

[@51:03](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=3063.23) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Like, I've not really sorted out like one of these. No, I'm kidding. They're good with each other insofar as, you know, they're in competition, so to speak, at the moment, or like maybe soft competition.  
They're cordial, and I don't think either one helps any hostility towards the other, but we do want to make sure that we balance the prominence of one over the other or whatever, as we're doing it, because we don't want to.

[@51:27](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=3087.27) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, I'm not trying to, I just want everyone to be able to get content.

[@51:30](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=3090.89) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I'm not really, I'm agnostic about which platform they pull from. I don't give a . I hate both of the platforms, so.  
I mean, now that we know that Joe knows how to code, we could have just done this ourselves. Yeah, I'm tempted to do that, but I don't want to.  
Yeah.

[@51:54](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=3114.21) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)  
I don't think you want to. There's too many things that can go wrong.

[@51:58](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=3118.91) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that is one of the problems. Okay, so Joe's going to start working on a website. We're going to find out from Johnny about email.  
We're going to talk to John about open editorial meetings. And then you've already got the conversation going with the folks about the content license and John about the RSS feed.

Right. And the RSS feed conversation will be with Johnny. We're just waiting for NJ Spotlight to say who it's going to be.  
I'm really confused, and I don't know whether John Mooney is confused. Like, he's bringing in his managing editor on this into the RSS feed conversation.  
The government? that's – pardon? McAlpin? Exactly. Like, this seems to be more like who's running your CMS and how easy can

I've tried to make that clear in the emails, but I don't know how to navigate that part of their operation.  
I mean, I've tried to make clear to John Mooney that this is like, we just need someone who could find the switches to make this a full-born RSS feed that could be, even if it's not public, but is within this.  
You know.

[@53:34](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=3214.15) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)

So, uh... So... Do you want me to just call him and try to explain, like, I always find, like, meetings are more effective the fewer people, you know, if it's like three or four people, they're great, and once it gets bigger, it gets unwieldy.

Yes, call him. It's so funny, because we were just talking about how that happens to me on meetings, when people are talking to me, and I don't realize they're looking at me, and I'm over here going like this, and I'm thinking I agree with them, but I just, a little.  
Yeah, no, yes, that's one of his ticks. How's it going be years of back pay? Okay, Johnny, John Mooney just responded, and so did Johnny.  
So, and one of. Network tech guys get us. Okay.

I just asked him in the email he responded to with us. So we'll see what he says. Okay. Okay, cool.  
So he said you can do the email that I just feature. No. We don't want that. Yep. We saw that.  
We want to create a custom one-off email to our group anytime we want. Not scheduled. Okay. Okay. You feel good, Andy?  
feel like you can know what you got going?

Yeah. So I guess one of my questions is, should I should. Should But so my next steps, aside from getting the DML licensing emails out to the other people, which I've done, is trying to arrange a meeting among the people who will be taking the content and trying to arrange that meeting for early January.

And that is the people taking the DML or taking Plucky or whatever?

[@56:22](https://fathom.video/share/2W5Z7dMdmq_Hdv6Ptg1UD87_PRzrh57D?timestamp=3382.87) \- Andrew Lehren (Montclair State U)

And is that for to show them how to take it? Can we just send an email, guess, is my question.

Could that meeting be an email? Well, they'd need to see the site.

And I think the idea is Johnny would give them a haven't seen the site. Okay. Oh, because we just did the makers last time.  
Correct. I gotcha.

I gotcha. And the reason why we did that was we wanted to do the makers so we could get content in the site.  
That's right. So then when we show it to the takers, they'd actually see stories they might conceivably be interested in.

So let's set that meeting up. And it sounds like it might be two meetings, one with Plucky and one with DML.

We could see how it works with Plucky. Let's just do Plucky because you actually have to sign in for Plucky.  
DML, they literally just put a widget on their website once they select what they want.

No, not for DML. Once you slap that widget wherever you want, whatever news product you want to put it on, if it's your homepage or a sidebar in article pages or its own landing page or in a newsletter, you just smack the widget in there.

So we really hope to get, like, area journalists to attend. And so if you could even talk about, you know, this content sharing effort or just collaboration, local collaborations in general on how to make it happen.  
And so that reporters who might be a different ethnic or community news orgs might find ways to connect and just your thoughts on, like, best practices, you know.

Let me think about that a little bit. I'm also thinking other parts of the Northeast, like the Granite State News Collaborative is a great example, and New Hampshire is not far.  
And sometimes Melanie does come down for meetings in New York. I'm also trying to think of a couple of people who might be good to speak, who might just be able to, who might be interested in attending, and it's not a far, you know, train ride for them or drive.  
Yeah.
